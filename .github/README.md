<h2>yeti: domesticate your diff</h2>

a beast that camps between your working directory and Git, sniffing through messy diffs and leaving behind clean, intentional history.

### your mess

you panic-stage everything at 2 AM and type "misc fixes". Your future self hates you.

### the yeti way

run `yeti`. it studies your changes, crafts a sharp conventional commit like `feat(home): add homepage layout and routing`, shows you exactly what it thinks happened, and only commits after you nod in approval.

### claws

| Command | What It Does |
|---------|--------------|
| `yeti` | single intelligent commit from your current mess |
| `yeti compose` | split sprawling chaos into logical chunks |
| `yeti branch` | when your changes clearly wandered off the mountain |
| `yeti amend` | clean up last night's regret |
| `yeti plan` | preview how your diff should be organized |

### rules

- no auto-push
- no silent rewrites
- no pretending to be Git
- just cold, clean history you won't be embarrassed by
